Project / Website Title: LAKAN THOUGHTS

Introduction:
  This website is about the organization of University of the Philippines Diliman students who hail from Bulacan. It is sort of a fusion of a company website and a blog site. I have chosen this type because for the longest time our organization has not had a website. In this website, members will be able to share their stories and experiences with our projects presented as well. The audience will also be able to comment or react about how they feel with the post by sending an e-mail. Anyone will be able to add a profile to the website to access member's information.

Developer:

Intended User / Client:
  Our intended users are anyone especially Bulakenyos. We believe that creating this website will be able to inspire the younger generation to serve the people and their fellowmen and fall in love with the idea of volunteerism.
